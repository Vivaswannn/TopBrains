Only Devart has the right to generate the Activation Keys. Upon purchase of the Software or an authorized transfer of the Software, Devart will promptly provide you with the necessary Activation Keys.

You are prohibited from attempting to crack, alter, or otherwise derive the Activation Keys. You do not have the right to distribute, publish, publicly display, or otherwise disseminate the Software Activation Keys to any persons, organizations, entities, newsgroups, locations, or websites. To unlock, access, activate, and use the Software, you may only use Activation Keys provided by Devart, which may be obtained either through a purchase from an authorized reseller or directly from Devart. Only these Activation Keys are valid for use. The use of Activation Keys obtained through unauthorized means constitutes a violation of this EULA and may result in the termination of this, and any other, license agreement(s) with Devart.

If the Software you have obtained is marked as a "Trial" version, you may install and use it for up to 30 calendar days from the date of activation (the "Trial Period"), provided that it is used solely for evaluation purposes and not for the development or deployment of any application in production. You may not use applications developed with Trial versions of the Software for any commercial purposes. Upon expiration of the Trial Period, you may either register the Software, continue using the Express version, or uninstall the Software. All copies of the Software and its accompanying written materials must then be destroyed.
