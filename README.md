# Assignment Repository

This repository contains my assignments organized across **separate branches** instead of the main branch.

## 📌 Important for Reviewers

Please do **not** review only the `main` branch.
Each assignment has been uploaded to its **own dedicated branch**.

## ✅ How to Check Assignments

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **branch selector** (usually shows `main` by default).
3. Switch to the required assignment branch.
4. Review the files inside that branch.

## 🌿 Branch Structure

* Each branch = one assignment submission
* Branch names follow this pattern:

  ```
  assignment-1
  assignment-2
  assignment-3
  ```

  *(or similar naming based on the task)*

## 📝 Note

This structure is used to keep assignments clean, isolated, and easy to review individually.

Thank you for reviewing 🙌
